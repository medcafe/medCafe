This is a local stand alone implimentation of a rest api storing data in mongo, with a few tweaks
to search fhir data structures.

Snarfed from: 

http://backbonetutorials.com/nodejs-restify-mongodb-mongoose/ 

$ node server   

Next, you will need to open browser and point it to:

http://localhost:8080/

If you'd like to see the raw messages as a json dump, you can point your browser to: 

http://localhost:8888/messages 

This static server is taken very largely (line for line) from this example:
